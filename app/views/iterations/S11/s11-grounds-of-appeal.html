        Grounds of appeal

        Hypothesis / Experiment
      </h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          <strong>We believe that </strong> by asking appeal writers to
            <ul>
              <li>
                list the grounds raised by the appellant
              </li>
              <li>
                respond to each ground separately
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We will </strong>
          make the appeal responses more personal and comprehensive
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We'll know this is true when </strong>
          the appellant and the judiciary do not perceive the appeal response is a standard document
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        What's new or changed?
      </h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          A structured questions based approach to responding to the grounds of appeal
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow appeal writers to gather all the grounds of appeal at one place and respond to each
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        What did we learn?
      </h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          There was a desire to group similar grounds and reply to the group rather than individual ground
        </li>
        <li>
          It wasn't intuitive that the appeal writers could add multiple grounds relating to the same appeal
        </li>
        <li>
          Appeal writers might not know all the legilations for the type-ahead to work
        </li>
        <li>
          There might be more than one evidence supporting the response
        </li>
      </ul>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Next steps
      </h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          For our MVP, "Grounds of Appeal" would be out of scope and hence we will not iterate on this further as of now.
        </li>
      </ul>
