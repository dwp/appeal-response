        Hypothesis / Experiment

        <li>
          <strong>We have seen that </strong>
          <br>AWs spend a lot of time populating some parts of the response<br>There can be errors in some parts of the form
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We think this is because </strong> AWs have to refer to and copy from various DWP systems to populate parts of the response other than the response reasoning itself
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>So if we </strong> Automatically pre-populate some of the form, where we already hold the relevant data in DWP systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We will see </strong> <br>AWs will be able to work more efficiently<br>Reduced errors or inconsistencies in response documents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We'll know this is true when </strong> <br>Appeals processing throughout increases with no reduction in quality. <br>
          Internal quality metrics show accuracy improvements.<br>
          AWs report that they are able to spend more of their time on high-value response writing activity.

        What did we learn?

        <li>
          No clear indication yet whether task-list approach is preferable to a single-page approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where value was seen in the task list, it seemed to be around:

          Recognising where there may be something missing.

          ‘Neater’ presentation.

          “That’s a lot of information and a lot of scrolling. I think on balance I’d prefer to have it split like this”

          	- AW, referring to single-page design while viewing task list design.

        <li>
          ‘Blue box’ seems valid (so far)
        </li>
        <li>
          Different data may be needed depending on which benefit line (NINO)
