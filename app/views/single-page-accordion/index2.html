David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2] which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette.[3] The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.

                      According to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo,[1] which came from Old High German "halÃ¢, holÃ¢, emphatic imperative of halÃ´n, holÃ´n to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman".[5] It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holÃ  (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French lÃ  'there').[6] As in addition to hello, halloo,[7] hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.[8][9][10]

                      Telephone
                      The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo.[11] Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting.[12][13] However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:

                      Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away. What you think? Edison - P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.[11]
                      By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[13][14]

                      Hullo
                      Hello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello",[15] and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803.[16] The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.[17][18][19][20][21]

                      Hallo and hollo
                      "Hallo" redirects here. For other uses, see Hallo (disambiguation).
                      Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa).[22] The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:[23]

                      If I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.

                      â€”â€‰Coriolanus (I.viii.7), William Shakespeare
                      Fowler's has it that "hallo" is first recorded "as a shout to call attention" in 1864.[24] It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:

                      And the good south wind still blew behind,
                      But no sweet bird did follow,
                      Nor any day for food or play

                      Came to the mariners' hollo!
                      In many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, "hallo" literally translates into English as "hello". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.[25]

                        A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[citation needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.

                        Hibiscus[2][3] is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow. Other names include hardy hibiscus, rose of sharon, and tropical hibiscus.
