              My appeal is late as my partner died in January and I have been struggling to cope with his death on top of my health problems. We were only able to hold his funeral this week and I was not able to deal with the appeal until after that. In the circumstances, I would be grateful if my late appeal would be accepted.

              I suffer from anxiety and depression. I also have arthritis that affects my knees, feet, hips and hands. I also suffer from bladder incontinence. I was not awarded any points despite having difficulties with most of the activities of daily living and mobility. I struggle to prepare and cook myself a meal due to the pain I experience. I cannot stand for long enough to make myself something and I also have problems with my hands – I cannot hold things and find opening packets and tins really hard. I even struggle to light the hob because I haven’t got the grip in my hands. I only eat soft foods because I do not have many teeth and if I eat anything else I start to choke. I also need help to cut my food up because I do not have the grip in my hands. I cannot get my tablets out of the packets so my son has to do that for me. He also has to prompt me to take my medication as I often do not want to. I have a walk in shower with a seat. I have to use the seat as I cannot stand for long enough to wash myself due to the pain in my hips and knees. I find it really difficult to bend to wash and dry my feet. I have to wear pads all of the time because I cannot control my bladder, I wet myself several times a day. My daughter has to help me get dressed. She helps me put on knickers, trousers, socks because bending is so painful. I have had to buy shoes that are slip on because I cannot do laces anymore. Any fastenings like buttons and zips is difficult for me to do because of my hands. People often tell me they cannot understand me – they say that I talk too fast and they cannot work out what I am saying. This upsets me as I feel I cannot get across what I need to say. I don’t always understand what is said to me either and that causes problems. I wear glasses but even with them on I find it hard to read small print and have to use a magnifying glass. I get very nervous around people I do not know to the point that I end up shaking.
